    "translation": "BG 10.16-17:Please describe to me Your divine opulences, by which You pervade all the worlds and reside in them. O Supreme Master of Yog, how may I know You and think of You. And while meditating, in what forms can I think of You, O Supreme Divine Personality?",
    "commentary": "Here, Yog refers toYogmaya(God’s divine power), and yogi refers to the Master ofYogmaya. Arjun has understood that Shree Krishna isBhagavān. He now wishes to know in what other ways, yet untold, is Shree Krishna’svibhūti(transcendental majestic opulence) displayed throughout creation. He wishes to hear about Shree Krishna’s eminence and paramount position as the Supreme Controller of all creation. Thus, he implores, “I am inquisitive to know your divine manifestations so that I may be endowed with unfaltering devotion. But the revelation of your personality is impossible to receive without your grace. So please be merciful and reveal your many glories by which I may perceive you.”"
