    "commentary": "7.7 Mattah than Me? The next higher? Not not? Otherwise other? Something anyone? Is there is? Dhananjaya O Dhananjaya? Mayi in Me? Everything all? This is this? Protam is strung? Formulas on a string? clusters of gems? It is like.Commentary There is no other cause of the universe but Me. I alone am the the cause of the universe. This illustration of gems and thread illustrates only the idea that all beings and the whole world are threaded on the Lord. The thread is not the cause of the gems. As Brahman is all in all there is nothing whatever higher than It."
