    "translation": "BG 6.46:A yogi is superior to thetapasvī(ascetic), superior to thejñānī(a person of learning), and even superior to thekarmī(ritualistic performer). Therefore, O Arjun, strive to be a yogi.",
    "commentary": "Atapasvī(ascetic) is one who accepts voluntary mortification and lives an extremely austere lifestyle, refraining from sensual pleasures and the accumulation of material wealth, as an aid in the pursuit of salvation. Ajñānīis a person of learning who actively engages in the cultivation of knowledge. Akarmīis one who performs the Vedic rituals for attaining material opulence and the celestial abodes. Shree Krishna declares the yogi to be superior to them all. The reason for this is simple. The goal of thekarmī, jñānī,andtapasvīis worldly attainment; they are still at the bodily platform of existence. The yogi is striving not for the world, but for God. As a result, the yogi’s accomplishment is at the spiritual platform and is superior to them all."
