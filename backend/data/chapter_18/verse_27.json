    "commentary": "Therājasicworkers are being described here. While thesāttvicworkers are motivated by the desire for spiritual growth, therājasicworkers are deeply ambitious for materialistic enhancement. They do not realize that everything here is temporary and will have to be left behind one day. Agitated with immoderaterāg(desires of the mind and senses), they do not possess the purity of intention. They are convinced that the pleasure they seek is available in the things of the world. Hence, never satisfied by what comes their way, they arelubdhaḥ(greedy for more). When they see others succeeding or enjoying more than them, they becomehinsātmakaḥ(enviously bent on injury). To fulfill their ends, they sometimes sacrifice morality, and hence becomeaśhuchiḥ(impure). When their desires are fulfilled they become elated, and when they are daunted they get dejected. In this way, their lives becomeharṣha śhoka anvitaḥ(a mixture of delights and sorrows)."
