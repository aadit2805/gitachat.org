    "translation": "BG 11.39:You areVāyu(god of wind),Yamraj(god of death),Agni(god of fire),Varuṇ(god of water), andChandra(moon-god). You are the creator Brahma, and the Great-grandfather of all beings. I offer my salutations unto You a thousand times, again and yet again!",
    "commentary": "Experiencing profuse reverence toward Shree Krishna, Arjun is offering repeated obeisancessahasra-kṛitvaḥ(thousands and thousands of times). During Diwali celebrations in India, sugar sweets are made in many shapes—elephant, horse, man, woman, dog, etc. But the ingredient in all of them is the same sugar. Similarly, the celestial gods have their distinct personalities and unique set of duties to discharge in the administration of the world. However, the same one God sitting in all of them manifests the special powers they possess. Consider another example. Varieties of ornaments are made from gold. They all have their distinct individuality, and yet they are all gold. So, just as gold is not an ornament, but ornaments are golden, likewise God is all thedevatāsbut thedevatāsare not God. Hence, in this verse, Arjun says that Shree Krishna is alsoVāyu, Yamrāj, Agni, Varuṇ, Chandra,and Brahma."
