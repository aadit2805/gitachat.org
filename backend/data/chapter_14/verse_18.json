    "commentary": "Shree Krishna explains that the reincarnation of the souls in their next birth is linked to theguṇasthat predominates their personality. Upon completion of their sojourn in the present life, the souls reach the kind of place that corresponds to theirguṇas. This can be compared to students applying for college admission after completing school. There are many colleges in the country. Those students with good qualifying criteria at the school level gain admission in the best colleges, while those with poor grades and other scores are admitted to the worst ones. Likewise, the Bhāgavatam says: sattve pralīnāḥ svar yānti nara-lokaṁ rajo-layāḥ tamo-layās tu nirayaṁ yānti mām eva nirguṇāḥ(11.25.22)[v2] “Those who are insattva guṇareach the higher celestial abodes; those who are inrajo guṇareturn to the earth planet; and those who are intamo guṇago to the nether worlds; while those who are transcendental to the three modes attain Me.”"
