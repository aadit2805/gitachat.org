    "commentary": "The material nature is called Maya, orprakṛiti.  Being an energy of God, it has existed ever since He has existed; in other words, it is eternal.  The soul is also eternal, and here it is calledpuruṣh(the living entity), while God Himself is calledparam puruṣh(the Supreme Living Entity). The soul is also an expansion of the energy of God.śhaktitvenaivāṁśhatvaṁ vyañjayanti(Paramātma Sandarbh 39.1) “The soul is a fragment of thejīva śhakti(soul energy) of God.”  While material nature is an insentient energy, thejīva śhaktiis a sentient energy.  It is divine and intransmutable.  It remains unchanged through different lifetimes, and the different stages of each lifetime.  The six stages through which the body passes in one lifetime are:asti(existence in the womb),jāyate(birth),vardhate(growth),vipariṇamate(procreation),apakṣhīyate(diminution),vinaśhyati(death).  These changes in the body are brought about by the material energy, calledprakṛiti, or Maya.  It creates the three modes of nature—sattva, rajas,andtamas—and their countless varieties of combinations."
