  "commentary": "3.26 न not? बुद्धिभेदम् unsettlement in the mind? जनयेत् should produce? अज्ञानाम् of the ignorant? कर्मसङ्गिनाम् of the persons attached to actions? जोषयेत् should engage? सर्वकर्माणि all actions? विद्वान् the wise? युक्तः balanced? समाचरन् performing.Commentary An ignorant may says to himelf? I shall do this action and thery enjoy its fruit. A wise man should not unsettle his belief. On the contrary"
