  "translation": "As a lamp placed in a windless spot does not flicker, so is the Yogi of a controlled mind, who practices Yoga in the Self, compared.",
  "commentary": "6.19 यथा as? दीपः lamp? निवातस्थः placed in a windless place? न not? इङ्गते flicker? सा that? उपमा simile? स्मृता is thought? योगिनः of the Yogi? यतचित्तस्य of one with controlled mind? युञ्जतः of the practising? योगम् the Yoga? आत्मनः of the Self.Commentary This is a beautiful simile. Yogins ote this simile very often when they talk of concentration or steadiness or onepointedness of the mind. A steady mind will serve as a powerful searchlight to find out the hidden spiritual treasures of the Self."
