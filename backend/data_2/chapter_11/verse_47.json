    "translation": "BG 11.47:The Lord said: Arjun, being pleased with you, by MyYogmayapower, I gave you a vision of My resplendent, unlimited, and primeval cosmic form. No one before you has ever seen it.",
    "commentary": "Since Arjun had become fearful and beseeched that the cosmic form be hidden, Shree Krishna now pacifies him by explaining that there is no need to be scared. He had bestowed a vision of his universal form by his grace, not as a form of punishment, but because he was very pleased with Arjun. He uses hyperbole as a figure of speech to stress how rare it is to see the universal form, by saying that Arjun is the first one to see it. Although Duryodhan and Yashoda were also given a glimpse of the universal form, it was not to this intensity, depth, and magnitude. Shree Krishna bestowed this divine vision upon Arjun with the help of hisYogmayaenergy. This is the divine all-powerful energy of God. He has referred to it in many places, such as verses 4.6 and 7.25. It is by virtue of thisYogmayaenergy that God iskartumakartum anyathā karatum samarthaḥ“He can do the possible, the impossible, and the contradictory at the same time.” This divine power of God also manifests in the personal form and is worshipped in the Hindu tradition as the Divine Mother of the universe, in the form of Radha, Durga, Lakshmi, Kali, Sita, Parvati, etc."
