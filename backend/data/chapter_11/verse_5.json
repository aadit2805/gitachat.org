    "commentary": "After listening to Arjun’s prayers, Shree Krishna now asks him to have a vision of hisviśhwarūp, or universal form. He uses the wordpaśhya, meaning “behold” to indicate that Arjun must pay attention. Although the form is one, it has unlimited features, and contains innumerable personalities of multitude shapes and variegated colors. Shree Krishna uses the phraseśhataśho ’tha sahasraśhaḥto indicate they exist in innumerable fashions and multitude ways. Having asked Arjun to behold his universal form with infinite shapes and colors, Shree Krishna now asks Arjun to observe the celestial gods and other wonders in that cosmic form."
