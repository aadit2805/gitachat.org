    "translation": "BG 16.22:Those who are free from the three gates to darkness endeavor for the welfare of their soul, and thereby attain the supreme goal.",
    "commentary": "In this verse, Shree Krishna gives the result of renouncing lust, anger, and greed. As long as these are present, one is attracted towardpreya, or happiness that seems sweet in the present but becomes bitter in the end. But when materialistic yearnings diminish, the intellect, freeÂ from the material mode of passion, is able to perceive the shortsightedness of pursuing the path ofpreya. Then one gets drawn towardshreya, or happiness that is unpleasant in the present but becomes sweet in the end. And for those attracted toshreya, the path of enlightenment opens up. They begin endeavoring for the eternal welfare of their soul, thereby moving toward the supreme goal."
