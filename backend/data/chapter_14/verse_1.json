    "translation": "BG 14.1:The Divine Lord said: I shall once again explain to you the supreme wisdom, the best of all knowledge; by knowing which, all the great saints attained the highest perfection.",
    "commentary": "In the previous chapter, Shree Krishna had explained that all life forms are a combination of soul and matter. He had also elucidated thatprakṛiti(material nature) is responsible for creating the field of activities for thepuruṣh(soul). He added that this does not happen independently, but under the direction of the Supreme Lord, who is also seated within the body of the living being. In this chapter, he goes on to elaborate in detail about the three-fold qualities of material nature (theguṇas). By gaining this knowledge and imbibing it into our consciousness as realized wisdom, we can ascend to the highest perfection."
