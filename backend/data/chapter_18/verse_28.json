    "commentary": "Shree Krishna now gives a description oftāmasicworkers. Their mind is blotted with negative obsessions and thus they areayuktaḥ(undisciplined). The scriptures give injunctions regarding what is proper and improper behavior. But workers in the mode of ignorance arestabdhaḥ(obstinate in their views), for they have closed their ears and mind to reason. Thus, they are oftenśhaṭhaḥ(cunning) andnaiṣhkṛitikaḥ(dishonest or vile) in their ways. They areprākṛitaḥ(vulgar) because they do not believe in controlling their animal instinct. Though they may have duties to perform, they see effort as laborious and painful, and so they arealasaḥ(slothful) anddīrgha-sūtrī(procrastinating). Their ignoble and base thoughts impact them more than anyone else, making themviṣhādī(unhappy and morose). The Śhrīmad Bhāgavatam also describes types of performers of actions: sāttvikaḥ kārako ’saṅgī rāgāndho rājasaḥ smṛitaḥ tāmasaḥ smṛiti-vibhraṣhṭo nirguṇo mad-apāśhrayaḥ(11.25.26)[v20] “The worker who is detached issāttvicin nature; the one who is excessively attached to action and its results isrājasic; one who is devoid of discrimination istāmasic. But the worker who is surrendered to me is transcendental to the three modes.”"
