    "translation": "BG 1.29-31:My whole body shudders; my hair is standing on end. My bow, the Gāṇḍīv, is slipping from my hand, and my skin is burning all over. My mind is in quandary and whirling in confusion; I am unable to hold myself steady any longer. O Krishna, killer of the Keshi demon, I only see omens of misfortune. I do not foresee how any good can come from killing my own kinsmen in this battle.",
    "commentary": "Here Arjun has addressed Shree Krishna asKeśhava, killer of a demon called Keshi. Yet, for Arjun the thought of killing his own relatives troubled him to such an extent that, his body started to tremble. He was unable to even hold his magnificent bowGāṇḍīv,which could emit sounds that petrified even the most powerful enemies. Arjun had become so disillusioned that superstition started gripping him. He could only see bad omens indicating severe devastation. Thus, he felt it would be a sin to engage in such a battle."
