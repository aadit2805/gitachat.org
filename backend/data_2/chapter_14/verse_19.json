    "translation": "BG 14.19:When wise persons see that in all work there is no agent of action other than the threeguṇas, and they know Me to be transcendental to theseguṇas, they attain My divine nature.",
    "commentary": "Having revealed the complex workings of the threeguṇas, Shree Krishna now shows the simple solution for breaking out of their bondage. All the living entities in the world are under the grip of the threeguṇas, and hence theguṇasare the active agents in all the works being done in the world. But the Supreme Lord is beyond them. Therefore, he is calledtri-guṇātīt(transcendental to the modes of material nature). Similarly, all the attributes of God—his names, forms, virtues, pastimes, abodes, saints—are alsotri-guṇātīt. If we attach our mind to any personality or object within the realm of the threeguṇas, it results in increasing their corresponding color on our mind and intellect. However, if we attach our mind to the divine realm, it transcends theguṇasand becomes divine. Those who understand this principle start loosening their relationship with worldly objects and people, and strengthening it, throughbhakti, with God and the Guru. This enables them to transcend the threeguṇas, and attain the divine nature of God. This is further elaborated in verse 14.26."
