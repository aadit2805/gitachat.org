  "commentary": "6.33 यः which? अयम् this? योगः Yoga? त्वया by Thee? प्रोक्तः taught? साम्येन by eanimity? मधुसूदन O slayer of Madhu? एतस्य its? अहम् I? न not? पश्यामि see? चञ्चलत्वात् from restlessness? स्थितिम् continuance? स्थिराम् steady.Commentary As the mind is restless? impetuous and unsteady I find it difficult to practise this Yoga of eanimity declared by Thee. O my Lord? I cannot have steady concentration of the mind? as it wanders here and there in the twinkling of an eye."
