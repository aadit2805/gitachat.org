    "commentary": "It is said that the good are drawn to the good and the bad to the bad. Those intamo guṇaare drawn toward ghosts and spirits, despite the evil and cruel nature of such beings. Those who arerājasicget drawn to theyakṣhas(semi-celestial beings who exude power and wealth) andrākṣhasas(powerful beings who embody sensual enjoyment, revenge, and wrath). They even offer the blood of animals to appease these lower beings, with faith in the propriety of such lowly worship. Those who are imbued withsattva guṇabecome attracted to the worship of celestial gods in whom they perceive the qualities of goodness. However, worship is perfectly directed when it is offered to God."
