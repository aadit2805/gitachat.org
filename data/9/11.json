  "translation": "Fools disregard Me, clad in human form, not knowing My higher Being as the great Lord of all beings.",
  "commentary": "9.11 अवजानन्ति disregard? माम् Me? मूढाः fools? मानुषीम् human? तनुम् form? आश्रितम् assumed? परम् higher? भावम् state or nature? अजानन्तः not knowing? मम My? भूतमहेश्वरम् the Great Lord of beings.Commentary Fools only find fault with My pure nature? just as a man with jaundiced eyes finds all objects to be yellow. The man who is suffering from fever finds even milk as bitter as the essence of neem."
