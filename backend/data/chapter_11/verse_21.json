    "translation": "BG 11.21:All the celestial gods are taking Your shelter by entering into You. In awe, some are praising You with folded hands. The great sages and perfected beings are extolling You with auspicious hymns and profuse prayers.",
    "commentary": "Arjun is seeing here thek훮la r큰pof Shree Krishna, i.e. his form as all-devouring time. The marching onslaught of time consumes even the greatest of personalities, including the celestial gods. Arjun sees them entering the universal form, with folded hands, in subservience to thek훮la r큰pof God. At the same time, he sees the sages and perfected souls, extolling the Lord with their thoughts, words, and deeds."
