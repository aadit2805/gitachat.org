    "commentary": "Arjun says, “… hearing your nectar,” instead of “… hearing your words that are like nectar.” He has omitted “your words that are like.” This is a literary technique calledatiśhayokti, or hyperbole (statement of extreme expression), in which the subject of comparison is omitted. He also addresses Shree Krishna as Janardan, which means “a benevolent person from whom distressed people ask for relief.” Descriptions of God’s glories are like nectar for those who love him. He has been drinking Shree Krishna’s ambrosial nectar-like words with his ears, and he now cheers him, by sayingbhūyaḥ kathaya, “Once more! My thirst for hearing your glories is not satiated.” That is the nature of divine nectar. It satiates us while simultaneously increasing the thirst for more. The sages of Naimisharanya made a similar statement while hearing the Śhrīmad Bhāgavatam from Suta Goswami: vayaṁ tu na vitṛipyāma uttamaśhlokavikrame yachchhṛiṇvatāṁ rasajñānāṁ svādu svādu pade pade(1.1.19)[v16] “Those who are devoted to Lord Krishna never tire of hearing descriptions of his divine pastimes. The nectar of these pastimes is such that the more it is relished the more it increases.”"
