    "translation": "BG 6.32:I regard them to be perfect yogis who see the true equality of all living beings and respond to the joys and sorrows of others as if they were their own.",
    "commentary": "We consider all the limbs of our body as ours, and are equally concerned if any of them is damaged. We are incontrovertible in the conviction that the harm done to any of our limbs is harm done to ourselves. Similarly, those who see God in all beings consider the joys and sorrows of others as their own. Therefore, such yogis are always the well-wishers of all souls and they strive for the eternal benefit of all. This is thesama-darśhana(equality of vision) of perfected yogis."
