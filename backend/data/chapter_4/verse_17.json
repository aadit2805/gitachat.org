    "translation": "BG 4.17:You must understand the nature of all three—recommended action, wrong action, and inaction. The truth about these is profound and difficult to understand.",
    "commentary": "Work has been divided by Shree Krishna into three categories—action (karm), forbidden action (vikarm), and inaction (akarm). Action.Karmis auspicious actions recommended by the scriptures for regulating the senses and purifying the mind. Forbidden action.Vikarmis inauspicious actions prohibited by the scriptures since they are detrimental and result in degradation of the soul. Inaction.Akarmis actions that are performed without attachment to the results, merely for the pleasure of God. They neither have any karmic reactions nor do they entangle the soul."
