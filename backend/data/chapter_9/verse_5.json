    "commentary": "Beyond the two energies mentioned in the purport to the previous verse—MayaśhaktiandJīvaśhakti—there is a third energy of God.  This is calledYogmayaśhakti, which He refers to in this verse, as divine energy.Yogmayais God’s all-powerful energy.  It is calledkartum-akartum-samarthaḥ, or “that which can make the impossible possible,” and is responsible for many of the amazing things we attribute to His personality.  For example, God is seated in our hearts, yet we have no perception of Him.  This is because His divineYogmayapower keeps us aloof from Him. Similarly, God also keeps Himself aloof from the influence of Maya.  In the Bhagavatam, the Vedas praise the Lord: vilajjamānayā yasya sthātumīkṣhā-pathe ’muyā(2.5.13) “Maya feels embarrassed to even stand before God.”  Isn’t it a wonder that although God pervades Maya, the material energy, yet He is aloof from it?  This is again by the mysterious power ofYogmaya. If the world could influence God, then when it decays or is destroyed, His nature and personality will also deteriorate.  But despite all modifications in the world, God remains established in His personality.  Accordingly, the Vedas call God by the nameDaśhāṅgulī, or “ten fingers.”  He is in the world, and yet ten fingers beyond it—untouched by it."
