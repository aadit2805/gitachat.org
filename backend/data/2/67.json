The wind: the wind? boat boat? Iv like? Ambhasi in the water.Commentary The mind which constantly dwells on the sensual objects and moves in company with the senses destroys altogether the discrimination of the man. Just as the wind carries a boat away from its course? so also the mind carries away the aspirant from his spiritual path and turns,him towards the objects of the senses."
