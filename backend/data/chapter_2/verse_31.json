    "commentary": "Swa-dharmais one’s duty as an individual, in accordance with the Vedas. There are two kinds ofswa-dharmas, or prescribed duties for the individual—para dharma, or spiritual duties, andapara dharma, or material duties. Considering oneself to be the soul, the prescribed duty is to love and serve God with devotion. This is calledpara dharma. However, since a vast majority of humankind does not possess this spiritual perspective, the Vedas also prescribe duties for those who see themselves as the body. These duties are defined according to one’sāśhram(station in life), andvarṇa(occupation). They are calledapara dharma, or mundane duties. This distinction between spiritual duties and material duties needs to be kept in mind while understanding theBhagavad Gitaand the Vedic philosophy at large. By occupation, Arjun was a warrior, and so his occupational duty as a warrior was to fight for the protection of righteousness. Shree Krishna is calling thisswa-dharma, or prescribed duty at the bodily level."
