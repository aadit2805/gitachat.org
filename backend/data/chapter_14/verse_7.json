    "translation": "BG 14.7:O Arjun,rajo guṇais of the nature of passion. It arises from worldly desires and affections, and binds the soul through attachment to fruitive actions.",
    "commentary": "Shree Krishna now explains the working ofrajo guṇa, and how it binds the soul to material existence. The Patañjali Yog Darśhan describes material activity as the primary manifestation ofrajo guṇa. Here, Shree Krishna describes its principal manifestation as attachment and desire. The mode of passion fuels the lust for sensual enjoyment. It inflames desires for mental and physical pleasures. It also promotes attachment to worldly things. Persons influenced byrajo guṇaget engrossed in worldly pursuits of status, prestige, career, family, and home. They look on these as sources of pleasure and are motivated to undertake intense activity for the sake of these. In this way, the mode of passion increases desires, and these desires further fuel an increase of the mode of passion. They both nourish each other and trap the soul in worldly life. The way to break out of this is to engage inkarmyog, i.e. to begin offering the results of one’s activities to God. This creates detachment from the world, and pacifies the effect ofrajo guṇa."
