    "translation": "BG 9.16-17:It is I who am the Vedic ritual, I am the sacrifice, and I am the oblation offered to the ancestors.  I am the medicinal herb, and I am the Vedic mantra.  I am the clarified butter, I am the fire and the act of offering.  Of this universe, I am the Father; I am also the Mother, the Sustainer, and the Grandsire.  I am the purifier, the goal of knowledge, the sacred syllable Om.  I am the Ṛig Veda, Sāma Veda, and the Yajur Veda.",
    "commentary": "In these verses, Shree Krishna gives a glimpse into the various aspects of His infinite personality.Kratumeansyajña(sacrifice), such asagnihotrayajñasmentioned in the Vedas.  It also refers to theyajñas, such asvaiśhva devathat are described in the Smṛiti scriptures.Auṣhadhamrefers to the potency in medicinal herbs. Creation emanates from God, and hence He is itsPitā(Father).  Before creation, He holds the unmanifested material energy in His womb, and so He is also itsMātā(Mother).  He maintains the universe and nourishes it, and thus He is itsDhātā(Sustainer).  He is also the Father of Brahma, who is the creator, and hence, He is the Grandfather of this universe. The Vedas have emanated from God.  The Ramayan states:jākī sahaja svāsa śhruti chārī“God manifested the Vedas by His breath.”  They are the knowledge potency of God, and hence an aspect of His unlimited personality.  Shree Krishna states this truth dramatically by saying that He is the Vedas."
