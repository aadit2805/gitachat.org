    "translation": "BG 3.28:O mighty-armed Arjun, illumined persons distinguish the soul as distinct fromguṇasand karmas. They perceive that it is only theguṇas(in the shape of the senses, mind, and others) that move among theguṇas(in the shape of the objects of perception), and thus they do not get entangled in them.",
    "commentary": "The previous verse mentioned that theahankāra vimūḍhātmā(those who are bewildered by the ego and misidentify themselves with the body) think themselves to be the doers. This verse talks about thetattva-vit, or the knowers of the Truth. Having thus abolished the ego, they are free from bodily identifications, and are able to discern their spiritual identity distinct from the corporeal body. Hence, they are not beguiled into thinking of themselves as the doers of their material actions, and instead they attribute every activity to the movements of the threeguṇas. Such God-realized Saints say:jo karai so hari karai, hota kabīr kabīr[v17]“God is doing everything, but people are thinking that I am doing.”"
