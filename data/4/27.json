  "translation": "Others again sacrifice all the functions of the senses and those of the breath (vital energy, or Prana) in the fire of the Yoga of self-restraint, kindled by knowledge.",
  "commentary": "4.27 सर्वाणि all? इन्द्रियकर्माणि functions of the senses? प्राणकर्माणि functions of the breath (vital energy)? च and? अपरे other? आत्मसंयमयोगाग्नौ in the fire of the Yoga of selfrestraitn? जुह्वति sacrifice? ज्ञानदीपिते kindled by knowledge.Commentary Just as a lamp is kindled by oil? so also the fire of the Yoga of selfcontrol is kindled by knowledge. When the Yogi concentrates or fixes his mind on Brahman or the Self? the senses and the breath cease to function. The senses and the breath are absorbed into their cause."
