    "translation": "BG 1.27:Seeing all his relatives present there, Arjun, the son of Kunti, was overwhelmed with compassion, and with deep sorrow, spoke the following words.",
    "commentary": "Shree Krishna’s words had the desired effect on Arjun. Looking at the armies on both sides of the battlefield, his heart sank, they were all “Kurus” his relatives.  The brave warrior who wanted to punish the Kauravas for all their wickedness a few minutes back suddenly became fearful. Comprehending the devastation this war would cause, his valor started to diminish. Hence, Sanjay has called himKaunteyahthe son of Kunti, denoting that Arjun had become softhearted, similar to his mother.  However, Arjun was now very confused and his mind filled with questions."
