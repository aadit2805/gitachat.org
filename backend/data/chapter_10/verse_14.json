    "commentary": "Listening attentively to Shree Krishna’s divine opulence and unlimited supremacy in brief, Arjun’s thirst for hearing more has increased. Wanting Shree Krishna to further describe his glories, he wishes to assure the Lord that he is fully convinced. By using the wordyat, Arjun means that whatever Shree Krishna has said to him from the seventh to the ninth chapters, he holds as true. He asserts that all Shree Krishna has stated is factual and not any metaphorical description. He addresses Shree Krishna asBhagavān, or the Supreme Lord. The wordBhagavānis defined in Devī Bhāgavat Purāṇ in the following manner: aiśhwaryasya samagrasya dharmasya yaśhasaḥ śhriyaḥ jñānavairāgyośhchaiva ṣaṇṇāṁ bhagavānniḥ[v14] “Bhagavānis he who possesses these six opulences to the infinite extent—strength, knowledge, beauty, fame, opulence, and renunciation.” Thedevatās(celestial gods),dānavas(demons),mānavas(human beings) all have finite abilities to understand. They cannot comprehend the full identity ofBhagavān."
