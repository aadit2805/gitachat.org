    "chapter": 12,
    "verse": 20,
    "translation": "BG 12.20:Those who honor this nectar of wisdom declared here, have faith in Me, and are devoted and intent on Me as the supreme goal, they are exceedingly dear to Me.",
    "commentary": "Shree Krishna concludes the chapter by summing up His answer to Arjun’s question.  At the beginning of the chapter, Arjun had asked Him regarding whom He considered superior—those who are devoted to His personal form throughbhakti-yog, or those who worship the formless Brahman throughjñāna-yog.  Shree Krishna responded in the second verse that He considers them to be the highest yogis who steadfastly engage in devotion upon His personal form.  He then continued on the topic of bhakti by explaining first the means of performing devotion and then the qualities of His devotees.  He now ends with the affirmation that the supreme path of spirituality is bhakti.  Those who make the Supreme Lord as their goal and cultivate devotion with great faith, imbued with the virtues mentioned in the previous verses, such devotees are exceedingly dear to God."
