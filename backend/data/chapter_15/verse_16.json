    "commentary": "Shree Krishna says that there are two kinds of beings; thekṣhar(perishable) and theakṣhar(imperishable). All beings in the material realm are perishable, and those liberated are imperishable. Although all souls are eternal; in the material realm,Mayabinds the individual soul to a material body. From the tiniest insect to the celestial gods, all embodied living entities in the material world arekṣhar(perishable). They have to go through the repetitive cycle of birth and death of their material body. Whereas, theakṣhar(imperishable) souls possess an immortal body, which is free from the cycle of birth and death. They reside forever in the divine realm; the Abode of God."
