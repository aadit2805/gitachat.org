    "translation": "BG 18.21:That knowledge is to be considered in the mode of passion by which one sees manifold living entities in diverse bodies as individual and unconnected.",
    "commentary": "Shree Krishna now explainsrƒÅjasicknowledge. That knowledge is said to be in the mode of passion where the world is not seen in its connection with God, and thus the living beings are perceived in their plurality, with distinctions of race, class, creed, sect, nationality, etc. Such knowledge divides the one human society along innumerable lines. When knowledge unites, it is in the mode of goodness, and when knowledge divides, it is in the mode of passion."
