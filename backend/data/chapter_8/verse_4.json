    "chapter": 8,
    "verse": 4,
    "translation": "BG 8.4:O best of the embodied souls, the physical manifestation that is constantly changing is calledadhibhūta; the universal form of God, which presides over the celestial gods in this creation, is calledAdhidaiva; I, who dwell in the heart of every living being, am calledAdhiyajna, or the Lord of all sacrifices.",
    "commentary": "The universe is a kaleidoscope of all the physical manifestations of the five elements of nature: earth, water, fire, air, and space. This ever-changing universe is calledadhibhuta.Although thedevatasor the celestial gods administer the different departments of the universe, God has sovereignty, even over thedevatas. He isVirāṭPurusha,the complete cosmic personality who encompasses the entire material creation. Hence, God is calledAdhidaiva. Shree Krishna says that as the Supreme Soul orParamatma,He dwells in the hearts of all living beings of the universe. He is the one who bestows rewards for all our actions and the presiding divinity for all the yajna (sacrifices). Thus, He is also calledAdhiyajna,or the Lord of all sacrifices. Therefore, all yajna should be performed; for the satisfaction of this Supreme Divine Personality. So far, Shree Krishna has answered six out of the seven questions concerning the meanings of the various terms Arjun had asked at the beginning of this chapter. In the next few verses, Shree Krishna will answer Arjun’s seventh question regarding the moment of death."
