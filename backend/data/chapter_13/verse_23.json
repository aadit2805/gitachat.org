    "commentary": "Shree Krishna has explained the status of thejīvātmā(individual soul) within the body.  Now in this verse He explains the position of theParamātmā(Supreme Soul), who also resides within the body.  He previously mentioned theParamātmāin verse 13.3 as well, when He stated that the individual soul is the knower of the individual body while the Supreme Soul is the knower of all the infinite bodies. The Supreme Soul, who is located within everyone, also manifests in the personal form as Lord Vishnu.  The Supreme Lord in His form as Vishnu is responsible for maintaining this creation.  He resides in theKṣhīr Sāgar(the ocean of milk), at the top of the universe in His personal form.  He also expands Himself to reside in the hearts of all living beings as theParamātmā.  Seated within, He notes their actions, keeps an account of their karmas, and bestows the results at the proper time.  He accompanies thejīvātmā(individual soul) to whatever body it receives in each lifetime.  He does not hesitate in residing in the body of a snake, a pig, or insect.  The Muṇḍakopaniṣhad states: dvā suparṇā sayujā sakhāyā samānaṁ vṛikṣhaṁ pariṣhasvajāte tayoranyaḥ pippalaṁ svādvattya- naśhnannanyo abhichākaśhīti samāne vṛikṣhe puruṣho nimagno- ’nīśhayā śhochati muhyamānaḥ juṣhtaṁ yadā paśhyatyanyamīśha- masya mahimānamiti vītaśhokaḥ(3.1.1-2) “Two birds are seated in the nest (heart) of the tree (the body) of the living form.  They are thejīvātmā(individual soul) andParamātmā(Supreme Soul).  Thejīvātmāhas its back toward theParamātmā, and is busy enjoying the fruits of the tree (the results of the karmas it receives while residing in the body).  When a sweet fruit comes, it becomes happy; when a bitter fruit comes, it becomes sad.  TheParamātmāis a friend of thejīvātmā, but He does not interfere; He simply sits and watches.  If thejīvātmācan only turn around to theParamātmā, all its miseries will come to an end.”  Thejīvātmāhas been bestowed with free will i.e. the freedom to turn away or toward God.  By the improper use of that free will thejīvātmāis in bondage, and by learning its proper usage, it can attain the eternal service of God and experience infinite bliss."
