    "translation": "BG 18.55:Only by loving devotion to Me does one come to know who I am in Truth. Then, having come to know Me, My devotee enters into full consciousness of Me.",
    "commentary": "Shree Krishna stated in the previous verse that on becoming situated in transcendental knowledge one develops devotion. Now he says that only through devotion can one come to know God’s personality. Previously, thejñānīhad realized God as thenirguṇa(quality-less),nirviśheṣha(attribute-less),nirākār(formless)Brahman. But thejñānīhad no realization of the personal form of God. The secret of that personal form cannot be known throughkarm, jñāna, aṣhṭāṅg yog,etc. It is love that opens the door to the impossible and makes way for the inaccessible. Shree Krishna states here that the mystery of God’s form, virtues, pastimes, abode, and associates can only be comprehended through unalloyed devotion. The devotees understand God because they possess the eyes of love. The Padma Purāṇ mentions a beautiful incident illustrating the above truth. Aṛiṣhiby the name of Jabali saw a very effulgent and peaceful maiden meditating in the forest. He requested her to reveal her identity and purpose of meditation. She replied: brahmavidyāhamatulā yogiṁdrairyā cha mṛigyatesāhaṁ hari padāmbhoja kāmyayā suchiraṁ tapaḥcharāmyasmin vane ghore dhyāyantī puruṣhottamambrahmānandena pūrṇāhaṁ tenānandena tṛiptadhīḥtathāpi śhūnyamātmānaṁ manye kṛiṣhṇaratiṁ vinā[v29] “I amBrahma Vidyā(the science of knowing the self, which ultimately leads to theBrahmanrealization of God). Great yogis and mystics perform austerities to know me. However, I am myself performing severe austerities to develop love at the lotus feet of the personal form of God. I am replete and satiated with the bliss ofBrahman. Yet, without loving attachment to Lord Krishna, I feel empty and void.” Thus, mere knowledge is insufficient for relishing the bliss of the personal form of God. It is throughbhaktithat one enters into this secret and achieves full God-consciousness."
