  "commentary": "7.25 न not? अहम् I? प्रकाशः manifest? सर्वस्य of all? योगमायासमावृतः veiled by YogaMaya? मूढः deluded? अयम् this? न not? अभिजानाति knows? लोकः world? माम् Me? अजम् unborn? अव्ययम् imperishable.Commentary I am not manifest to all the people? but I am certainly manifest to the chosen few who are My devotees? who have taken sole refuge in Me alone. I am not visible to those who are deluded by the three"
