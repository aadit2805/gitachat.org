    "translation": "BG 6.8:The yogi who are satisfied by knowledge and discrimination, and have conquered their senses, remain undisturbed in all circumstances. They see everything—dirt, stones, and gold—as the same.",
    "commentary": "Jñāna, or knowledge, is the theoretical understanding obtained by listening to the Guru and from the study of the scriptures.Vijñānais the realization of that knowledge as an internal awakening and wisdom from within. The intellect of the advanced yogibecomes illumined by bothjñānaandvijñāna. Equipped with wisdom, the yogi sees all material objects as modifications of the material energy. Such a yogi does not differentiate between objects based on their attractiveness to the self. The enlightened yogi sees all things in their relationship with God. Since the material energy belongs to God, all things are meant for his service. The wordkuṭastharefers to one who distances the mind from the fluctuating perceptions of senses in contact with the material energy, neither seeking pleasurable situations nor avoiding unpleasurable ones.Vijitendriyais one who has subjugated the senses. The wordyuktmeans one who is in constant communion with the Supreme. Such person begins tasting the divine bliss of God, and hence becomes atṛiptātmā, or one fully satisfied by virtue of realized knowledge."
