    "translation": "BG 3.39:The knowledge of even the most discerning gets covered by this perpetual enemy in the form of insatiable desire, which is never satisfied and burns like fire, O son of Kunti.",
    "commentary": "Here, the inimical nature ofkāmor lust is being made even more explicit by Lord Krishna.kāmmeans “desire,”duṣhpūreṇameans “insatiable,”analameans “inexhaustible.” Desire overpowers the discriminatory power of the wise and lures them to fulfill it. However, the more they attempt to dowse the fire of desire, the more strongly it burns. The Buddha states: na kahāpaṇa vassena, titti kāmesu vijjati appassādā kāmā dukhā kāmā, iti viññāya paṇḍito (Dhammapada verse 186) [v20] “Desire burns like an unquenchable fire, which never brings happiness to anyone. The wise renounce it, knowing it to be the root of misery.” But those who do not understand this secret waste away their life in the futile pursuit of trying to satiate their lust."
