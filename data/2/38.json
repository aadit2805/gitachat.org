  "translation": "Having made pleasure and pain, gain and loss, victory and defeat equal, engage in battle for the sake of battle; thus, you shall not incur sin.",
  "commentary": "2.38 सुखदुःखे pleasure and pain? समे same? कृत्वा having made? लाभालाभौ gain and loss? जयाजयौ victory and defeat? ततः then? युद्धाय for battle? युज्यस्व engage thou? न not? एवम् thus? पापम् sin? अवाप्स्यसि shalt incur.Commentary This is the Yoga of eanimity or the doctrine of poise in action. If anyone does any action with the above mental attitude or balanced state of mind he will not reap the fruits"
