    "translation": "BG 10.23:Amongst therudrasknow Me to be Shankar; amongst the semi-celestial beings and demons I am Kuber. I amAgniamongst thevasusand Meru amongst the mountains.",
    "commentary": "Therudrasare the eleven forms of Lord Shiv—Hara, Bahurupa, Tryambaka, Aparajita, Vrisakapi, Shankar, Kapardi, Raivata, Mrigavyadha, Sarva, Kapali. The Puranas have named them differently in different places. Amongst these, Shankar is the original form of Lord Shiv in the universe. Yakṣhas(semi-celestial beings) are beings who are very fond of acquiring wealth and hoarding it. Their leader, Kuber, is the god of wealth and the treasurer of the celestial gods. He thus reflects thevibhūtiof God amongst the demons. There are eightvasus—land, water, fire, air, space, sun, moon, and stars. They constitute the gross structure of the universe. Amongst these,agni(fire) gives warmth and energy to the rest of the elements. Thus, Shree Krishna mentions it as his special manifestation. Meru is a mountain in the celestial abodes famed for its rich natural resources. It is believed to be the axis around which many heavenly bodies rotate. Shree Krishna thus speaks of it as his glory. As wealth distinguishes a wealthy person, these glories reveal thevibhūtisof God."
