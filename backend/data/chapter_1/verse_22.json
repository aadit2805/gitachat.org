    "commentary": "Arjun was a skilled warrior, and the most powerful Hanuman was sitting on top of his magnificent chariot. Moreover, his devotion towards the Supreme Lord Shree Krishna was such that, the Lord himself had agreed to be Arjun’s charioteer. Here, Arjun was seated on the passenger seat giving instructions to Shree Krishna, his charioteer. He addresses the Lord asAchyuta, the most dependable One and requests him to place the chariot in the middle of the battlefield. ahaṁ bhakta-parādhīno hyasvatantra iva dvijasādhubhir grasta-hṛidayo bhaktair bhakta-jana-priyaḥ(Bhagavatam 9.4.63) “Although I am Supremely Independent, yet I become enslaved by My devotees.  They are very dear to Me, and I become indebted to them for their love.”  Such is the beauty of God’s bond with his devotees that He gets enslaved, beholden by His devotees’ love."
