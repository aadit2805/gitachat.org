    "commentary": "Shree Krishna once again refers to the three modes of nature. In chapter 14, he had given an introduction about these modes, and described how they bind the soul to thesamsaraof life and death. Then in chapter 17, he went into great detail about how these three modes influence the kinds of faith people develop and also their choice of foods. He also explained the three categories of sacrifice, charity, and penance. Here, according to the threeguṇas, the Lord will explain the three types of knowledge, action, and doers. Amongst the six systems of thought in Indian philosophy, theSānkhyaphilosophy (also calledpuruṣh prakṛiti vāda) is recognized as the authority in the matter of analysis of material nature. It considers the soul as thepuruṣh(lord), and thus recognizes manypuruṣhas.Prakṛitiis the material nature and includes all things made from it.Sānkhyastates the cause for misery is the desire of thepuruṣhto enjoyprakṛiti. When this enjoying propensity subsides, then thepuruṣhis released from the bondage of material nature attains eternal beatitude. TheSānkhyasystem does not acknowledge the existence of theParam Puruṣh, or the Supreme Lord, and hence it is insufficient for knowing the Absolute Truth. However, in the matter of knowledge aboutprakṛiti(material nature), Shree Krishna refers to it as the authority."
