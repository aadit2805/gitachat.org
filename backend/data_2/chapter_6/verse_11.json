    "translation": "BG 6.11:To practice Yog, one should make anāsan(seat) in a sanctified place, by placing Kuśh grass, deer skin, and a cloth, one over the other. Theāsanshould be neither too high nor too low.",
    "commentary": "Shree Krishna explains in this verse the external practice forsādhanā.Śhuchau deśhemeans a pure or sanctified place. In the initial stages, the external environment does impact the mind. In later stages ofsādhanā, one is able to achieve internal purity even in dirty and unclean places. But for neophytes, clean surroundings help in keeping the mind clean as well. A mat of Kuśh grass provides temperature insulation from the ground, akin to the yoga mats of today. The deer skin atop it deters poisonous pests like snakes and scorpions from approaching while one is absorbed in meditation. If theāsanis too high, there is the risk of falling off; if theāsanis too low, there is danger of disturbance from insects on the ground. Some instructions regarding external seating given in this verse may be somewhat anachronous to modern times, in which case the spirit of the instruction is to be absorbed in the thought of God, while the instructions for the internal practice remain the same."
