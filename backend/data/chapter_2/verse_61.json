    "translation": "BG 2.61:They are established in perfect knowledge, who subdue their senses and keep their minds ever absorbed in Me.",
    "commentary": "In this verse, the wordyuktaḥ(united) indicates “absorption in devotion,” andmat paraḥmeans “toward Lord Krishna.” The wordāsīta(seated) may be understood figuratively here to mean “situated or established.” Having said that the impetuous mind and senses need to be tamed, Shree Krishna now reveals the proper engagement for them, which is absorption in devotion to God. The example of King Ambarish in Śhrīmad Bhāgavatam illustrates this process this very beautifully: sa vai manaḥ kṛiṣhṇa-padāravindayor vacāhṁsi vaikuṇṭha-guṇānuvarṇanekarau harer mandira-mārjanādiṣhu śhrutiṁ chakārāchyuta-sat-kathodaye mukunda-liṅgālaya-darśhane dṛiśhau tad-bhṛitya-gātra-sparśhe ’ṅga-saṅgamamghrāṇaṁ cha tat-pāda-saroja-saurabhe śhrīmat-tulasyā rasanāṁ tad-arpite pādau hareḥ kṣhetra-padānusarpaṇe śhiro hṛiṣhīkeśha-padābhivandanekāmaṁ cha dāsye na tu kāma-kāmyayā yathottamaśhloka-janāśhrayā ratiḥ(9.4.18-20)[v52] “Ambarish engaged his mind in remembering the lotus feet of Shree Krishna. He engaged his tongue in chanting the wonderful names, forms, virtues, and pastimes of God. He used his ears in hearing narrations about the Lord, his eyes in seeing the beautiful deity of God in the temple, his sense of touch in massaging the feet of devotees of the Lord, his nostrils in smelling the aroma from fragrant objects that had been offered to the Lord in worship, his feet in circumambulating the temple, and his head in paying obeisance to God and His devotees. In this way, he subdued all his senses by engaging them in the service of the Supreme Lord.”"
