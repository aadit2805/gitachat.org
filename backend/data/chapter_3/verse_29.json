    "translation": "BG 3.29:Those who are deluded by the operation of theguṇasbecome attached to the results of their actions. But the wise who understand these truths should not unsettle such ignorant people who know very little.",
    "commentary": "The question may be raised that if soul is distinct from theguṇasand their activities, then why are the ignorant attached to sense objects? Shree Krishna explains in this verse that they become bewildered by theguṇasof the material energy, and think themselves to be the doers. Infatuated by the three modes of material nature, they work for the express purpose of being able to enjoy sensual and mental delights. They are unable to perform actions as a matter of duty, without desiring rewards. However, thekṛitsna-vit(persons with knowledge) should not disturb the minds of theakṛitsna-vit(persons without knowledge). This means that the wise should not force their thoughts onto ignorant persons by saying, “You are the soul, not the body, and hencekarmis meaningless; give it up.” Rather, they should instruct the ignorant to perform their respectivekarm, and slowly help them rise above attachment. In this way, after presenting the distinctions between those who are spiritually wise and those who are ignorant, Shree Krishna gives the sober caution not to unsettle the minds of the ignorant."
