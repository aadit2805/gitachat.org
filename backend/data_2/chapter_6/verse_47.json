    "commentary": "Even amongst yogis, there arekarm yogis, bhakti yogis, jñāna yogis, aṣhṭāṅg yogis,etc. This verse puts to rest the debate about which form of Yog is the highest. Shree Krishna declares thebhakti yogito be the highest, superior to even the bestaṣhṭāṅg yogiandhaṭha yogi. That is becausebhakti, or devotion, is the highest power of God. It is such a power that binds God and makes him a slave of his devotee. Thus, he states in the Bhāgavatam: ahaṁ bhakta-parādhīno hyasvatantra iva dvija sādhubhir grasta-hṛidayo bhaktair bhakta-jana-priyaḥ(9.4.63)[v27] “Although I am supremely independent, yet I become enslaved by my devotees. They conquer my heart. What to speak of my devotees, even the devotees of my devotees are very dear to me.” Thebhakti yogipossesses the power of divine love, and is thus most dear to God and considered by him to be the highest of all. In this verse, Shree Krishna has used the wordbhajate. It comes from the root wordbhaj, which means “to serve.” It is a far more significant word for devotion than “worship,” which means “to adore.” Here, Shree Krishna is talking about those who, not merely adore him, but also serve him with loving devotion. They are thus established in the natural position of the soul as the servant of God, while the other kinds of yogis are still incomplete in their realization. They have connected themselves with God, but they have not yet situated themselves in the understanding that they are his eternal servants. muktānām api siddhānāṁ nārāyaṇa-parāyaṇaḥ su-durlabhaḥ praśhāntātmā koṭiṣhv api mahā-mune(Bhāgavatam 6.14.5)[v28] “Amongst many millions of perfected and liberated saints, the peaceful person who is devoted to the Supreme Lord, Narayan, is very rare.” Another way of understanding this verse is thatbhakti yogprovides the closest and most complete realization of God. This is explained in verse 18.55, where Shree Krishna explains that thebhakti yogialone understands the true personality of God."
