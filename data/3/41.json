  "commentary": "3.41 तस्मात् therefore? त्वम् you? इन्द्रियाणि the senses? आदौ in the beginning? नियम्य having controlled? भरतर्षभ O best of the Bharatas? पाप्मानम् the sinful? प्रजहि kill? हि surely? एनम् this? ज्ञानविज्ञाननाशनम् the destroyer of knowledge and realisation (wisdom).Commentary Jnana is knowledge obtained through the study of scriptures. This is indirect knowledge or Paroksha Jnana. Vijnana is direct knowledge or personal experience or Anubhava through Selfrealisation or Aparoksha Jnana. Control the senses first and then kill desire."
