    "commentary": "In this chapter, Shree Krishna explained the categories ofyajña(sacrifice),tapaḥ(austerity), anddān(charity), according to the three modes of material nature. Amongst these three modes, the mode of ignorance degrades the soul into nescience, languor, and sloth. The mode of passion excites the living being and binds it in innumerable desires. The mode of goodness is serene and illuminating, and engenders the development of virtues. Yet, the mode of goodness is also within the realm of Maya. We must not get attached to it; instead, we must use the mode of goodness as a stepping-stone to reach the transcendental platform. In this verse, Shree Krishna goes beyond the threeguṇas, and discusses the wordsOm Tat Sat, which symbolize different aspects of the Absolute Truth.In the following verses, he explains the significance of these three words."
