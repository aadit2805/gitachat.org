    "commentary": "There are some yogis who follow the path of discrimination, orjñāna yog, and take the help of knowledge to withdraw their senses from the world. Whilehaṭha yogisstrive to restrain the senses with brute will-power,jñāna yogisaccomplish the same goal with the repeated practice of discrimination based on knowledge. They engage in deep contemplation upon the illusory nature of the world, and the identity of the self as distinct from the body, mind, intellect, and ego. The senses are withdrawn from the world, and the mind is engaged in meditation upon the self. The goal is to become practically situated in self-knowledge, in the assumption that the self is identical with the Supreme Ultimate reality. As aids to contemplation, they chant aphorisms such as:tattvamasi“I am That,” (Chhāndogya Upaniṣhad 6.8.7)[v21] andahaṁ brahmāsmi“I am the Supreme Entity.” (Bṛihadāraṇyak Upaniṣhad 1.4.10) [v22] The practice ofjñāna yogis a very difficult path, which requires a very determined and trained intellect. The Śhrīmad Bhāgavatam (11.20.7) states:nirviṇṇānāṁ jñānayogaḥ[v23] “Success in the practice ofjñāna yogis only possible for those who are at an advanced stage of renunciation.”"
