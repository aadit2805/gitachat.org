    "translation": "BG 5.17:Those whose intellect is fixed in God, who are completely absorbed in God, with firm faith in Him as the supreme goal, such persons quickly reach the state from which there is no return, their sins having been dispelled by the light of knowledge.",
    "commentary": "Just as ignorance causes one to suffer insamsara, or the perpetual cycle of life and death, knowledge has the power to release one from material bondage.  Such knowledge is always accompanied with devotion to God.  This verse makes very emphatic use of words denoting complete God-consciousness. Tadbuddhayaḥmeans the intellect is directed toward God. Tadātmanaḥmeans the heart (mind and intellect) is solely absorbed in God. Tanniṣhṭhāḥmeans the intellect has firm faith in God. Tatparāyaṇaḥmeans striving after God as the supreme goal and refuge. Thus, the sign of true knowledge is that it leads to love for God.Imbued with such love, devotees see Him everywhere. Such a divine vision is described in the next verse."
