    "commentary": "Earlier, Arjun had requested to see the universal form. When Shree Krishna exhibited it, Arjun became bewildered and agitated. Having witnessed an almost unbelievable cosmic spectacle, he now wants to know the very heart of God’s nature and purpose. Hence, he asks the question, “Who are you and what is your purpose?”"
