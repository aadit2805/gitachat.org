    "commentary": "Shree Krishna assures Arjun that those who equip themselves with the knowledge he is about to bestow will no longer have to accept repeated confinement in a mother’s womb. They will also not be obliged to stay in a state of suspended animation in the womb of God at the time of the universal dissolution, or be reborn along with the next creation. The threeguṇas(modes of material nature) are indeed the cause of bondage, and knowledge of them will illumine the path out of bondage. Shree Krishna repeatedly uses the strategy of proclaiming the results of what he is about to teach, to bring his student to rapt attention. The wordsna vyathantimean “they will not experience misery.” The wordsādharmyammeans they will acquire “a similar divine nature” as God himself. When the soul is released from the bondage of the material energy, it comes under the dominion of God’s divineYogmayaenergy. The divine energy equips it with God’s divine knowledge, love, and bliss. As a result, the soul becomes of the nature of God—it acquires divine godlike qualities."
