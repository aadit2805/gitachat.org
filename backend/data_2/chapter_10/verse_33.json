    "commentary": "In Sanskrit, all letters are formed by combining a half-letter with “a.” For example,क्+अ=क(k+a=ka). Hence, the letter “a” is the most important in the Sanskrit alphabet. “A” is also the first vowel of the alphabet, and since the vowels are written before the consonants, “A” comes at the very beginning. Although Sanskrit is such an ancient language, it is highly refined and sophisticated. A common procedure in Sanskrit language is to combine words to form compound words. When, in the process of making one compound word, two or more words give up their case endings, it is calledsamāsa, and the resulting word is calledsamāsa pada, or compound word. There are primarily six kinds ofsamāsa: 1)dwandva, 2)bahubṛihi, 3)karm dhāray, 4)tatpuruṣh, 5)dwigu, 6)avyayī bhāv. Amongst these,dwandvais the best because both words remain prominent in it, while in the others, either one word becomes more prominent, or both words combine together to give the meaning of a third word. The dual word Radha-Krishna is an example ofdwandva. Shree Krishna highlights it as hisvibhūti. Creation is a magnificent act and awesome to behold. Humankind’s most sophisticated and technologically advanced inventions pale in comparison. Therefore, Lord Krishna singles out the first-born Brahma, who made the entire universe, and says that amongst creators, the creative ability of Brahma best reflects the glory of God."
