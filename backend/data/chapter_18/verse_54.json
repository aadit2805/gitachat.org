    "commentary": "Shree Krishna concludes his description of the stage of perfection. The wordsBrahma-bhūtaḥmean the state ofBrahmanrealization. Situated in it, one isprasannātmā, meaning serene and unaffected by turbid and painful experiences.Na śhochatimeans one does not grieve nor feel any incompleteness.Na kāṅkṣhatimeans one does not crave for any material thing to make one’s happiness complete. Such a yogi sees all living beings with equal vision, realizing the substratum ofBrahmanin all of them. In such a state, one is situated on the platform of realized knowledge. However, Shree Krishna concludes the verse with a twist. He says that in such a realized state of knowledge, one then attainsparā bhakti(divine love) for God. Thejñānīsare often fond of saying thatbhaktiis only to be done as an intermediate step towardBrahmanrealization. They claim thatbhaktiis for the purpose of purifying the heart, and at the end of the journey, onlyjñānaremains. Thus, they recommend that those who possess a strong intellect can ignore devotion and simply cultivate knowledge. But the above verse negates such a viewpoint. Shree Krishna states that having attained the highest realization ofjñāna, one developsparā bhakti. Ved Vyas has declared the same in the Śhrīmad Bhāgavatam: ātmārāmāśh cha munayo nirgranthā apy urukramekurvanty ahaitukīṁ bhaktim ittham-bhūta-guṇo hariḥ(1.7.10)[v24] “Even those who areātmārām(rejoicing in the self), established in self-knowledge, and liberated from material bonds, such perfected souls desire to possessbhaktitoward God. The super-excellent qualities of God are such that they attract even the liberated souls.” There are many examples of renownedjñānīswho had attained self-knowledge and were situated in the realization of the formlessBrahman. However, when they got a glimpse of the transcendental divine qualities of God, they naturally got drawn towardbhakti. Instances of suchjñānīsfrom each of the fouryugasare given here. The greatestjñanīsinSatya Yugawere the four sons of Brahma—Sanat Kumar, Sanatan Kumar, Sanak Kumar, and Sanandan Kumar. They were self-realized from birth, and their minds were always absorbed in the formlessBrahman. These four brothers once visited Vaikunth, the divine abode of Lord Vishnu. There, the fragrance from thetulsī(holy basil) leaves at the lotus feet of the Lord entered their nostrils, causing a thrill of ecstasy in their hearts. Immediately, their meditation on the attributelessBrahmanended, and they were immersed in the bliss of divine love for Lord Vishnu. They beseeched him for a boon: kāmaṁ bhavaḥ sva-vṛijinair nirayeṣhu naḥ stāchcheto ’livad yadi nu te padayo rameta(Bhāgavatam 3.15.49)[v25] “O Lord, we do not even mind if you send us to hell, so long as our mind gets the opportunity to drink the divine love bliss that emanates from your lotus feet.” Just imagine, even after having realized the formlessBrahman, these foremostjñānīswere willing to reside in hell for the sake of relishing the bliss of the personal form of God. Let us now move on toTretā Yuga. The topmostjñānīin this age was King Janak. He was the father of Sita, the eternal consort of Lord Ram. He was also known asVideha, one who was beyond all perceptions of the body. His mind would remain ever absorbed in the formlessBrahman. One day, however, Sage Vishwamitra came to meet him, along with Lord Ram and Lakshman. What took place then is described in the Ramayan: inhani bilokata ati anurāgā, barabasa brahmasukhahi mana tyāgā[v26] “On seeing Lord Ram, King Janak became detached from the bliss of the formlessBrahman, and deeply attached to the personal form of the Supreme Lord.” In this manner, the greatestjñānīof the age ofTretācame to the path ofbhakti.” The topmostjñānīin the age ofDwāparwas Shukadev, the son of Sage Ved Vyas. The Puranas describe him as being so elevated that he remained in his mother’s womb for twelve years, thinking that if he came into the world, the material energy, Maya, would overpower him. Finally, Sage Narad came and spoke to him through his mother’s ear, reassuring him that nothing would happen and he should emerge from the womb. Finally, he emerged, and by his yogic power, he expanded his body to that of a twelve-year old and renounced home to live in the forest. There, he soon reached the highest state ofsamādhi. Years went by, and one day Ved Vyas’s students were cutting wood in the forest, when they saw him insamādhi. They went back and told the Sage about it. He told them to recite a verse in Shukadev’s ears, describing the beauty of the personal form of Lord Krishna: barhāpīḍaṁ naṭa-vara-vapuḥ karṇayoḥ karṇikāraṁbibhrad vāsaḥ kanaka-kapiśhaṁ vaijayantīṁ cha mālāmrandhrān veṇor adhara-sudhayāpūrayan gopa-vṛindairvṛindāraṇyaṁ sva-pada-ramaṇaṁ prāviśhad gīta-kīrtiḥ(Bhāgavatam 10.21.5)[v27] “Shree Krishna is adorned with a peacock feathered crown upon his head, and exhibits his form as the greatest dancer. His ears are decorated with bluekarṇikāflowers. His shawl is the color of brilliant gold. He wears a garland made ofvaijayantībeads. He fills the holes of his flute with the nectar from his lips. His praises are sung as he enters Vrindavan, surrounded by his cowherd friends, and the marks of his footprints beautify the earth.” Shukadev was absorbed in the formlessBrahmanwhen the verse entered his ears. Suddenly, the object of his meditation transformed into the enchanting form of Lord Krishna. He felt so deeply attracted to the bliss of the personal form of God, that he left hissamādhiand went back to his father, Ved Vyas. From him, he heard the Śhrīmad Bhāgavatam, which is full of the sweetness ofbhakti. Later, on the banks of the Ganges, he related it to King Parikshit, grandson of Arjun. In this manner, the greatestjñānīof the age ofDwāpargot drawn to the path ofbhakti. Finally, we come toKali Yuga. Jagadguru Shankaracharya is widely considered the greatestjñānīof this age. He is widely acclaimed as the propagator ofadvaita vāda(non-dualism), in which he stated that there is only one entity in existence, which is thenirguṇa(without qualities),nirviśheṣha(attributeless),nirākār(formless)Brahman. However, many people are unaware that from the age of twenty until he left his body at the age of thirty-two, he wrote hundreds of verses in praise of Lord Krishna, Lord Ram, Lord Shiv, Mother Durga, etc. He also visited the fourdhāms(centers of spirituality in the four corners of India), and worshipped deities of the personal forms of God in all of them. In Prabodh Sudhākar, he writes: kāmyopāsanayārthayantyanudinaṁ kiñchitphalaṁ swepsitamkechit swargamathāpavargamapare yogādiyajñādibhiḥasmākaṁ yadunandanāṅghriyugaladhyānāvadhānārthināmkiṁ lokena damena kiṁ nṛipatinā swargāpavargaiśhcha kim(verse 250)[v28] “Those who perform righteous actions for the attainment of celestial abodes may do so. Those who desire liberation via the path ofjñānaoraṣhṭāṅg yogmay pursue that goal. As for me, I want nothing of these two paths. I wish only to engross myself in the nectar of Shree Krishna’s lotus feet. I do not desire either worldly or heavenly pleasures, nor do I desire liberation. I am arasikwho relishes the bliss of divine love.” The fact is that Shankaracharya was a great devotee of Lord Krishna. What he taught in hisbhāṣhyas(commentaries) was the need of the times. When he appeared upon the earth, Buddhism was prevailing all over India. In such an environment, to reestablish the faith of the Buddhists in the Vedas, he sidelined devotion while writing hisbhāṣhyas. But later, in the numerousstutis(praises) he wrote for the personal forms of God, he revealed his inner devotion. Shankaracharya was thus an example in the age ofKali, of someone who had reached the highest realization ofjñāna, and who then did devotion."
