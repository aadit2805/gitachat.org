    "commentary": "Assādhaksadvance on the spiritual path, within their minds their relationship with God becomes stronger. At that time, they find the Vedic rituals they were previously performing to be cumbersome and time consuming. They then wonder whether they are obliged to keep performing the rituals, along with their devotion, and if they reject the ritual and dedicate themselves fully to theirsādhanā, will they be committing an offense? Such people will find the answer to their doubt in this verse. Shree Krishna says that to be fixed insādhanāwithout being allured to the fruitive sections of the Vedas is not an offence; rather, it is a higher spiritual state. Madhavendra Puri, the famous 14th century sage, states this sentiment very emphatically. He was a Vedic Brahmin and used to engage in extensive ritualistic practices, but then took tosanyās(the renounced order), and engaged wholeheartedly in devotion to Shree Krishna. In his later life, he wrote: sandhyā vandana bhadramastu bhavate bhoḥ snāna tubhyaṁ namaḥbho devāḥ pitaraśhchatarapaṇa vidhau nahaṁ kṣhamaḥ kṣhamyatāmyatra kvāpi niṣhadya yādava kulottaasya kansadviṣhaḥsmāraṁ smāramaghaṁ harāmi tadalaṁ manye kimanyena me[v46] “I wish to apologize to all kinds of rituals as I have no time to respect them. So dearSandhyā Vandan(a set of rituals performed thrice daily by those who have received the sacred thread), holy baths, sacrifices to the celestial gods, offerings to the ancestors, etc. please excuse me. Now, wherever I sit, I remember the Supreme Lord Shree Krishna, the enemy of Kansa, and that is sufficient to release me from material bondage.” Shree Krishna uses the wordsamādhāv-achalāin this verse, to refer to the state of steadfastness in divine consciousness. The wordSamādhihas been formed from the rootssam(equilibrium) anddhi(intellect), meaning, “a state of total equilibrium of the intellect.” One who is steadfast in the higher consciousness, unmoved by material allurements attains that state ofSamādhi, or perfect Yog."
