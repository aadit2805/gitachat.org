    "commentary": "All along, Shree Krishna had been asking Arjun to do two things simultaneously—engage his mind in devotion, and engage his body in fulfilling his material duty as a warrior. He thus wanted Arjun not to give up his Kshatriyadharma, but to do devotion alongside with it. This is the principle ofkarm yog. Now, Shree Krishna reverses this teaching by saying that here is no need to fulfill even materialdharma. Arjun can renounce all material duties and simply surrender to God. This is the principle ofkarm sanyās. Here, one may question that if we give up all our materialdharmaswill we not incur sin? Shree Krishna tells Arjun not to fear; he will absolve him from all sins, and liberate him from material existence. To comprehend this instruction of Shree Krishna, we need to understand the termdharma. It comes from the root worddhṛi, which meansdhāraṇ karane yogya, or “responsibilities, duties, thoughts, and actions that are appropriate for us.” There are actually two kinds ofdharmas—materialdharmaand spiritualdharma. These two kinds ofdharmaare based upon two different understandings of the “self.” When we identify ourselves as the body, then ourdharmais determined in accordance with our bodily designations, obligations, duties, and norms. Hence, serving the bodily parents, fulfilling the responsibilities to society, nation, etc. are all bodilydharma. This is also calledapara dharmaor materialdharma. This includes thedharmaas a Brahmin, Kshatriya, etc. However, when we identify ourselves as the soul, we have no material designations ofvarṇa(social class) andāśhram(status in life). The soul’s Father, Mother, Friend, Beloved, and resting place are all God. Hence our one and onlydharmabecomes loving devotional service to God. This is also calledpara dharmaor spiritualdharma. If one leaves the materialdharmait is considered a sin due to dereliction of duty. But if one leaves materialdharmaand takes the shelter of spiritualdharma, it is not a sin. The Śhrīmad Bhāgavatam states: devarṣhi-bhūtāpta-nṛiṇāṁ pitṝīṇāṁ na kiṅkaro nāyam ṛiṇī cha rājansarvātmanā yaḥ śharaṇaṁ śharaṇyaṁ gato mukundaṁ parihṛitya kartam(11.5.41)[v37] This verse explains that for those who do not surrender to God, there are five debts—to the celestial gods, to the sages, to the ancestors, to other humans, and to other living beings. Thevarṇāśhramsystem includes various procedures for releasing ourselves from these five kinds of debts. However, when we surrender to God, we are automatically released from all these debts, just as by watering the roots of a tree, all its branches, twigs, leaves, flowers, and fruit automatically get watered. Similarly, by fulfilling our duty to God, we automatically fulfill our duty to everyone. Hence, there is no sin in renouncing materialdharmaif we are properly situated in spiritualdharma. In fact, the ultimate goal is to engage completely and wholeheartedly in spiritualdharma. The Śhrīmad Bhāgavatam states: ājñāyaivaṁ guṇān doṣhān mayādiṣhṭān api svakāndharmān santyajya yaḥ sarvān māṁ bhajeta sa tu sattamaḥ(11.11.32) [v38] “I have given innumerable instructions regarding the performance of bodilydharmain the Vedas. But those who realize the shortcomings in these, and renounce all prescribed duties, to simply engage in my devotional service, I consider them to be the bestsādhaks.” In the Ramayan, we read how Lakshman renounced all material duties to accompany Lord Ram in the forest. He said: guru pitu mātu na jānahu kāhū, kahahu subhāū nātha patiyāūmore sabahiñ eka tumha swāmī, dinabhandhu ura antarayamī[v39] “O Lord, please believe me, I do not know any teacher, father, mother, etc. As far as I am concerned, you, the savior of the fallen and the knower of the heart, are my Master and my everything.” Similarly, Prahlad said: mātā nāsti pitā na ’sti na ’sti me swajano janaḥ[v40] “I do not know any mother, father, or relative (God is everything to me).” In theBhagavad Gita, Shree Krishna gave Arjun sequentially higher instructions. Initially, he instructed Arjun to dokarm, i.e. his materialdharmaas a warrior (verse 2.31). But materialdharmadoes not result in God-realization; it leads to the celestial abodes, and once the pious merits are depleted one has to come back. Hence, Shree Krishna next instructed Arjun to dokarm yog, i.e. his materialdharmawith the body and spiritualdharmawith the mind. He asked Arjun to fight the war with the body and remember God with the mind (verse 8.7). This instruction ofkarm yogforms the major portion of the Bhagavad Gita. Now in the very end, Shree Krishna instructs Arjun to practicekarm sanyās, i.e. renounce all materialdharmaand simply adopt spiritualdharma, which is love for God. He should thus fight, not because it is his duty as a warrior, but because God wants him to do so. But why did Shree Krishna not give this instruction to Arjun earlier? Why did he seem to clearly extol just the reverse in verse 5.2 when he stated karm yog superior as to karm sanyās? Lord Krishna clearly explains this in the next verse."
