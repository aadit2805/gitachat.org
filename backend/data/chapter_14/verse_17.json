    "commentary": "Having mentioned the variation in the results that accrue from the threeguṇas, Shree Krishna now gives the reason for this.Sattva guṇagives rise to wisdom, which confers the ability to discriminate between right and wrong. It also pacifies the desires of the senses for gratification, and creates a concurrent feeling of happiness and contentment. People influenced by it are inclined toward intellectual pursuits and virtuous ideas. Thus, the mode of goodness promotes wise actions.Rajo guṇainflames the senses, and puts the mind out of control, sending it into a spin of ambitious desires. The living being is trapped by it and over-endeavors for wealth and pleasures that are meaningless from the perspective of the soul.Tamo guṇacovers the living being with inertia and nescience. Shrouded in ignorance, a person performs wicked and impious deeds and bears consequent results."
