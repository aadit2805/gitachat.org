    "commentary": "Kavayaḥare the learned. Shree Krishna states that learned people considersanyāsas the renunciation of works. Those who renounce works for material enjoyment and enter the renounced order are calledkarm sanyāsīs. They continue to do some of thenitya karm(daily works for the maintenance of the body), but they renouncekāmya karm(works related to acquisition of wealth, progeny, prestige, status, power, etc). Such works bind the soul further in the wheel of karma and lead to repeated rebirths in thesamsaraof birth and death. Vichakṣhaṇāḥare the wise. Shree Krishna states that wise people lay emphasis ontyāg, meaning “internal renunciation.” This implies not relinquishing the prescribed Vedic duties, rather renouncing the desires for enjoying their fruits. Therefore, the attitude of giving up attachment to the rewards of actions istyāg, while the attitude of giving up works is sanyas. Bothsanyāsandtyāgseem plausible and reasonable options to pursue for enlightenment. Of these two courses of action, which one does Shree Krishna recommend? He provides more clarity on this topic in the subsequent verses."
